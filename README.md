# Piratas do Futuro Project
# History
This project was created during my last year in computer engineering graduation course. 
It was selected by FAPEMIG (if I'm not wrong) and received one year of sponsorship, wich was used to design the first version of the software - which was also presented as my TCC (in Brasil, the conslusion work).
After I completed my graduation, I started working in the university, and the teacher that oriented the first version of the project invited me to be a co-orienter, and propose to the same sponsor a new version of this project.
The project after some more years of development, is ready to be tested by a complete student class.
